# Orbital impulsive maneuvers
Orbital maneuvers transfer a spacecraft from one orbit to another. Orbital changes can be both dramatic and quite small depending on the goal of the mission. During the class of introduction to the analysis of space missions we were only concerned with impulsive maneuvers (idealization), those in which brief  firings of  onboard rocket motors change the magnitude and direction of  the velocity  vector  instantaneously.  During  an  impulsive  maneuver,  the  position  of the  spacecraft  is  considered  to  be  fixed;  only  the  velocity  changes $\Delta v$. This idealization results to be correct for those situations in which the position of the spacecraft changes only slightly during the time the maneuvering rockets fire.

Using the defined maneuvers the task of the project was to design the cheaper transfer that made it possible to travel from the starting position of the initial orbit, to the final orbit linked to $\theta$ value. Considering every impulsive maneuvers at our disposal the challenge was to find the best trade off transfer that combined these and guaranteed to accomplish the transferral mission. A trade-off was needed in order to assure both a minimized $\Delta v$  and a minimized $\Delta t$  necessary to get from the injection point to the point of the final orbit.
